# vulcan-testing-app
A small application I originally used to learn golang, but has since expanded into a single repo containing the same webapp (basic CRUD for god's of several ancient pantheons) written in several languages.

This allows easy testing of new features/use cases in different languages and serves as a proof of competency for the language.

All applications services and databases are also instrumented with Datadog to allow for in depth monitoring and tracking using all of its features.
