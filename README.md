# vulcan-testing-app
A small application I originally used to learn GO, but has since expanded into a single repo containing the same webapp (basic CRUD for god's of several ancient pantheons) wortten in several languages.

This allows easy testing of new features in different languages and serves as a proof of competency for said language.

All applications services and databases are also instrumented with Datadog to allow for in depth monitoring and tracking using all of its features.
